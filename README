This is a simple QML application which tracks an RSS feed pictures from it
in full screen.

The feed is refreshed every 10 minutes. Images are cached on disk. You must
ensure the disk cache is large enough for the whole feed, otherwise images
will be reloaded every time the currently displayed image changes. The cache
size is set in main.cpp.

You may also interact using left and right swipes and by pressing the left
and right arrow keys.

Usage:

qmlrss <rss feed url>

for example:

qmlrss http://imgur.com/r/earthporn/rss
qmlrss http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml

Compiling:

qmake && make
